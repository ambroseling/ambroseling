# What am I up to?

## Neurosience Research @ LinLabs
In the summer of 2023, I worked on a neuroscience research project with Professor Qian Lin that aims to study the neurodynamics of zebrafish behaviour under different visual and electrical stimuli. By using zebrafish tracking softwares such as Python Stytra and DeepLabCut, we were able to analyse behavioural responses from their change in position and tail angle. Thus, using deep learning models, we were able to feed response data into neural networks in order to make future predictions on their behaviour. On top of that, I was responsible in creating a Virtual Reality environment that is to be presented to zebrafish as visual stimulus in order to study their spatial recognition abilities.

## LINKUPSS Co.
LINKUPSS is a tech start up aiming to simplify technology for seniors through making online resources accessible.Through working with day-care centers, community centers , engineers, we are working to break the digital divide for all generations.
Our tech start up is curretly in the UofT Entrepenurship Hatchery program working with an advisory board of industry professional mentors and connectors on building our buisness plan, conducting market research and customer outreach as well as cashflow projections. Our team has facilitated connections with over 116 senior organisations, 200+ seniors across Ontario, Canada with 40 organisations in progress of implementing our solutions. We're hoping to continue our efforts to reach as many organisations as possible and to help as much seniors as possible. Our start up idea was awarded the [Google Solutions Challenge 2023 Global Top 100 Qualifiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1npCEqfD8k4&t=15s). From that time, we have received mentorship from Google engineers and designers, thus making continous improvements and modifications to our design. Feel free to contact me to learn more or check out our [LINKUPSS website](https://www.linkupss.com)!


## Independent ML Projects & Tensorflow development
I am currently in the process of pursuing a Tensorflow Developer Certificate as I believe this is a great oppurtunity for me to showcase my skillset and knowledge in leading-edge ML topics. Throughout this process, I have developed a variety of ML models in binary, multiclass classification, linear regression, image classification, object detection, natural language processing, text generation, time-series and sequential analysis. As I plan to complete the exam very soon, I hope this would be a perfect way of demonstrating my competence in machine learning and open more doors for me in machine learning oppurtunities.

Some sample models:

- Tweet Disaster Classificatoin NLP [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13XAe8Hy_F3tCuDsWR55xzJlxI4BbihYy)
- Food 101 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1epo8WlfpE4FSRaQ6BIE14niTFKPZlkSt)

## Course Work
### RoastRoute: Coffee Date GIS (Software Communication & Design)
Our team of 3 developed a GIS platform using GTK, C++, FastAPI, OpenStreetMapAPI that allows users to organize a coffee date.
We implemented Dijkstra's algorithm with multithreading for path-finding, less than 0.15s computation time for paths above 15km.
We also applied the Greedy algorithm to tackle travelling courier problem, utilized local pertubations that improved path quality by 15%+.
Check out [our repository](http://ug251.eecg.utoronto.ca/wiki297s/doku.php?id=cd019:start) for more details!

### BuzzWire: ARM Cyclone V DE1-SoC (Computer Organization and Architecture)
BuzzWire is a hardware game that challenges contenders ability to focus and complete an exciting metal wire obstacle course using a wand. The DE1-Soc board is connected to a circuitry that reads changes in voltage values from the Analog to Digital Converter port and uses that to determine whether the player has touched the wire and ignited the bomb. We used the A9 Private Timer to count down 30 seconds as a time constraint for players as well as used the VGA display to show a graphical user interface about when the game is in progress and when the player has won or lost, we also played an explosion sound effect when users lost through the Sound/Audio I/O ports of the board. It was a rewarding experience for my partner Areeba and myself. Check out [our repository](https://github.com/ambroseling/BuzzWire) for more details!
