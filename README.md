# What am I up to?

## Neurosience/Deep Learning Research @ LinLabs
In the summer of 2023, I worked on a neuroscience research project with Professor Qian Lin that aims to study the neurodynamics of zebrafish behaviour in spatial recognition and task learning. My research contributed to 2 areas:

**Zebrafish tracking**
- Implemented computer vision tracking with ResNet50, MobileNet architectures, achieved tracking accuracy of 75%+ 
- Preprocessed images by applying normalization,resizing and scaling, preprocessed labels by converting coordiantes to gaussian distributed heat map 
- Optimized real-time tracking prediction speed by 55% (measured by timer) with parallel computing in Tensorflow, that would help minimize the latency in the experimental system
- Designed image preprocessing software, allowed other students to label images and speed up experiments
- Instructed other lab members on how to use tracking software such as the web app, stytra, deeplabcut
- Leveraged GPU to speed up tail tracking model training
- Assisted with hardware testing
- Helped facilitate socket connections from Stytra Python to Unity

For more details and code, check out our [repo](https://github.com/ambroseling/Zebrafish-DeepLabCut)

**Locomotion Prediction** 
- Presented papers on continous time recurrent neural networks, Neural ODE networks, LTC networks in journal clubs
- Implemented the benchmark autoregressive model for predicting zebrafish movement in VR, clearly demonstrated weaknesses in their model and datasets
- Preprocessed public  tail deflection datasets by using noise reduction, local polynomial interpolation, normalization to handle uneven sampling
- Optimized movement predictions by developing our own multi layer GRU model, LTC model, and GRU encoder-LTC decoder model, beat the benchmark by 5% in MSE reduction, 6% in R^2 score increase
- Presented locomotion prediction research at Undegraduate engineering research conference, awarded Best Overall Poster Presentation
- Demonstrated a comprehensive model performance comparision, conducted parameter search to find best optimal working model

## Course Work
### RoastRoute: Coffee Date GIS (Software Communication & Design)
Our team of 3 developed a **GIS platform** using the following technologies:
- GTK
- C++
- FastAPI
- OpenStreetMapAPI
This platform enables users to efficiently organize coffee dates. Our project includes the following achievements:
- Implemented **Dijkstra's algorithm** with multithreading for path-finding.
- Achieved impressive computation times: less than 0.15 seconds for paths above 15 km.
- Addressed the traveling courier problem using the **Greedy algorithm**.
- Incorporated local perturbations to enhance path quality by more than 15%.

### BuzzWire: ARM Cyclone V DE1-SoC (Computer Organization and Architecture)
**BuzzWire** is a hardware game designed to test players' focus and skills in navigating an exciting metal wire obstacle course using a wand. The key features of this project include:
- Integration of the **DE1-Soc board** with circuitry.
- Reading voltage changes from the Analog to Digital Converter port to detect player interactions with the wire.
- Utilizing the **A9 Private Timer** to enforce a 30-second time constraint for players.
- Displaying a graphical user interface through the **VGA display** to indicate game progress and outcomes.
- Playing an explosion sound effect via the **Sound & Audio I/O** ports when players lose.
- A collaborative effort by Areeba and myself, resulting in a rewarding experience.
